## Forest status in 2000

At the beginning of the millennium, more than half (54.3%) of the island of Borneo, which has an area of 728,799 km\textsuperscript{2}, was covered with primary forests. The remaining areas were 30.4% covered with >= 75% closed tree canopy, and 15.3% with less dense vegetation, respectively. @fig-piefcover2000 provides an overview of the composition of vegetation on Borneo at the start of the study period.

![Composition of vegetated areas on Borneo at the start of the study period.](../code/results/final_plots/fcover_2000.png){#fig-piefcover2000 width="70%"}

The >= 75% closed canopy consits of secondary forests as well as plantations. 4886 km\textsuperscript{2} or 2.2% of the >75% forest cover represent oil palms (stand 2000 or detection up to 2003), with a lot of these oil palm plantations being close to typical plantation patterns (see annex IV).  Another notable characteristic are large areas close to rivers, especially with human settlements nearby, that have lot of dense vegetation right next to primary forests (see annex V).

## Deforestation

In the years from 2001 to 2021, a total of 16.81 Mha of deforestation occured. 6.13 Mha of this is within primary forests and 10.68 Mha outside of primary forests. In both, logging was mainly responsible for forest loss, compared to forest fires. While logging rates in secondary forests increased from 0.3 to almost 0.5 Mha per year by 2008, the five most deforestation-intensive years, with 0.61 - 0.75 Mha of forest loss, occurred between 2009 and 2016. After three years of steady deforestation at 0.5 Mha per year, less than 0.4 Mha of forest loss was recorded in 2020 and 2021 @fig-bardeforestation. Within primary forests, logging rates increased from 0.11 Mha in 2002 to a maximum of 0.50 in 2012 and declined back to 0.11 Mha in 2021 @fig-bardeforestationprimary. Although there was less overall forest loss in primary forests, there were more forest fires therein (0.81 Mha) than outside (0.72 Mha). Both primary and secondary forests had their highest forest fire rates, by a large margin, in 2016 with 208,000 ha (secondary forest) and 255,000 ha (primary forest). Other years with elevated forest fire rates were 2003, 2007, 2009, 2014 and 2015 ranging from 25,000 to 79,000 ha @fig-forestlossbarcharts.

Overview of deforestation within **(a)** secondary forests and **(b)** primary forests.

![Large areas in the Malaysian part of Borneo where logging activities are penetrating deep into the primary forest.](../code/results/maps/primary_deforestation.png){#fig-map_deforestation_primary}

In general, logging patterns can be separated into two categories. First, large areas of logging in the same year, often with sharp borders, and second, dispersed small-scale logging (@fig-map_deforestation_op_fires, @fig-mapdeforestation). This is especially the case in primary forests in the malaysian part of Borneo, where logging continously encroaches (@fig-map_deforestation_primary). Fires in secondary forests have no obvious patterns; they occur randomly and mainly on a small scale.

Protected areas cover 6.24 Mha, of which 0.08 Mha are secondary forest and 4.72 Mha is primary forest. Within protected areas, the main reason for forest loss were forest fires, regardless of the classification as primary or secondary forest. Forest fire area and logging rates are similar (@fig-forestlossbarcharts_PA). This is remarkable given that secondary forests accounted for a massively smaller proportion of the total area of PAs. Logging in protected areas occured very limited with an average of ~2,500 ha per year being logged. However, wildfires occurred irregularly, with a major spike in 2016 and other substantial forest loss to fires in 2003, 2007, and 2015 (@fig-bardeforestationprimary). These majority of these forest fires were on the edges of the forest spanning large patches (@fig-mapforestfires).

## Infrastructure

![Location of new built-up areas in the period between 2001 and 2020..](../code/results/final_plots/pie_new_built_up.png){#fig-forestloss_pie_new_built_up}

The built-up area within the study period has more than doubled to a total of 21,789 km\textsuperscript{2}.
:::

The built up areas have increased by 110% from 10,332 km\textsuperscript{2} in 2000 to a total of 21,729Â km\textsuperscript{2} in 2020. There was only modest overlap (0.8%) with forest loss in primary forests from built up areas in 2000, and more substantial (17.7%) with other dense vegetation areas. Looking at the maps, these can be attributed mainly to maintenance work and the corresponding cutting back of adjacent vegetation, as well on a smaller scale to the clearing of oil palm plantations for replanting. Annex III provides an representative example.

: Percentages of new and existing oil palm (OP) plantations within buffer distances from the total area of Borneo. The data is categorized into three sections: area of Borneo (portion of the total Bornean Area covered by the buffer), new OP buffer (portion newly detected oil palm from 2001 - 2017 within buffer area), and total OP (portion newly detected oil palm from 2001 - 2017 from all new oil palm area). This is done for **i)** _total_ infrastructure in 2020 (assuming no year 2000 built-up area was removed), **ii)** _existing_ (year 2000) built up area and **iii)** _new_ built-up area (2001 - 2020). {#tbl-buffer_op}
