Tropical forests play a more influential role in the climate cycle and various biodiversity processes in comparison to other terrestrial biomes [@zafirahSustainableEcosystemServices2017]. Their ecosystem services include regulation of the water cycle (quality and quantity), carbon storage, natural pest control, climate regulation, pollination and seed dispersal [@nasiForestEcosystemServices2002]. Undoubtedly, they possess the highest biological diversity, with estimates that consider the share of global biodiversity to be more than half [@jenkinsGlobalPatternsTerrestrial2013]. Additionally, tropical forests are also indispensable for social and cultural identity, livelihoods and climate change adaptation and mitigation [@omettoContributionWorkingGroup2022].\n\nForests also prevent nutrient runoff and erosion due to their vegetation cover [@sweeneyStreamsideForestBuffer2014]. Subsequently, deforestation can lead to enhanced sedimentation and thus shallower river networks. This in return can cause massive flood during monsoon season [@zafirahSustainableEcosystemServices2017].\n\nHowever, tropical forests are threatened, as over 90% of deforestation takes place in these zones [@faoGlobalForestResources2020]. Gaveau et al. indicated that three-quarters of Borneo was covered with forest in the early 1970s, reducing to only 390,000 km\\textsuperscript{2} (52.8%) remaining forested of which 210,000 km\\textsuperscript{2} are considered intact in 2010[-@gaveauFourDecadesForest2014]. Much of this deforestation is due to conversion to large-scale agricultural plantations (mainly soybeans, oil palm, corn, cotton, and livestock; see @sec-oilpalm), which represents one of the main causes of the decline in species richness in flora and fauna [@omettoContributionWorkingGroup2022; @jaureguiberryDirectDriversRecent2022]. \n\nThe protection of the forest is also important because it serves as CO\\textsubscript{2} reservoir, which is released by deforestation. Even if cultivated trees are subsequently grown, they cannot retain the same amount of CO\\textsubscript{2} [@waringForestsDecarbonizationRoles2020]. \n\nAnother major problem is forest degradation. Matricardi et al. state that forest degradation in the tropics occurs over even larger areas than it is deforested [-@matricardiLongtermForestDegradation2020]. However, it is much more difficult to measure because it occurs in the forest and leaves a closed canopy, making it challenging to use remote sensing methods. Forest and thus habitat degradation due to human proximity and use is further outlined in @sec-infrastructure.\n\n## Infrastructure {#sec-infrastructure}\nExpansion of infrastructure is happening at a high rate across the globe. In the last two decades, the amount of built-up land area has increased by 47%, whereby this rate is even higher in Asia at 73% [@potapovGlobal20002020Land2022]. With an additional 25 million kilometers of paved roads and more than 300,000 kilometers of rail track, translating into a 60% expansion of land transportation infrastructure by 2050 compared to 2010, infrastructure development will continue at a rapid rate [@ieaGlobalLandTransport2013; @lauranceGlobalStrategyRoad2014]. With an estimated 90% of this growth taking place in developing countries, the consequences for Borneo will be enormous. \n\nWith deforestation and infrastructure development in remote areas, hunting pressure is intensifying [@kamyabElaeisGuineensis2022], as well as poaching with improved accessibility [@mooreAreRangerPatrols2018]. In addition, the expansion of habitation of humans stimulated by infrastructure developments is leading to an increase in human-wildlife conflicts [@kamyabElaeisGuineensis2022]. \n\nNot only does new infrastructure increase settlement and thus human density. It is also associated with greater dispersal pressure of invasive species, leading to new corridors such as roads or rail tracks that facilitate the introduction of invasive species [@mungiRoleSpeciesRichness2021; @darRoadsActCorridors2015]. Moreover, the resulting increase in light pollution affects the behavior of individual animal species, which in turn can influence their ecosystem services, eventually leading to effects of land erosion [@lewanzikArtificialLightPuts2014].\n\nSince large parts of Borneo are covered with forest, new infrastructure projects must cut through these areas, separating and isolating large interconnected habitats. Although ecologists agree that habitat loss has far-reaching and detrimental consequences for biodiversity (see @sec-deforestation, @sec-oilpalm), there is disagreement about the impact that fragmentation itself has [@didhamRethinkingConceptualFoundations2012a; @fahrigRethinkingPatchSize2013; @haddadHabitatFragmentationIts2015a; @miller-rushingHowDoesHabitat2019]. Observational studies often focused only on single aspects of fragmentation (e.g., edge, isolation, area) and failed to take in the full context of the complex, interconnected structures of habitats [@haddadHabitatFragmentationIts2015a]. However, a comprehensive experiment indicated, that biodiversity in fragmented habitats is reduced from 13 up to 75% [@haddadHabitatFragmentationIts2015a]. More recently, PÃ¼ttker et al. underlined that biodiversity of forest-dependent animal and, to an even greater extent, plant species are negatively affected by habitat fragmentation, especially through edge effects [-@puttkerIndirectEffectsHabitat2020]. \n\nTo sum up, the expansion of infrastructure contributes not only to habitat loss, but also to increased habitat isolation due to fragmentation, increased introduction of invasive species, and light pollution. \n\n## Oil palm _(Elaeis guineensis)_ [@kamyabElaeisGuineensis2022] {#sec-oilpalm}\n\nOriginating from West Africa, the oil palm _(Elaeis guineensis)_ is the most efficient and important oil-producing crop worldwide, with a llifespan of ~25 years. It has the highest yield in tropical climates with high rainfall. Hence it is successfully cultivated in Malaysia and Indonesia, with yields ranging from 10 to 35 tons of fresh fruit bunch (FFB) per hectare. These two countries produce 85% of the world's palm oil.\n\n- add information on economic value and total used lands [@descalsHighresolutionGlobalMap2021]\n\nWhile the massive expansion of production capacities over the last decades is associated with economic growth and rapid development, the ecological impact of deforestation for giant oil palm monocultures and the environmental pollution caused by large quantities of by-products, mainly palm oil mill effluent (POME), during oil extraction pose major problems. The conversion from tropical forest to oil palm plantations is estimated to lose up to 45% of species diversity, density and biomass of invertebrate communities [@barnesConsequencesTropicalLand2014]. Moreover, the drainage of peatlands for land preparation causes the release of large amounts of GHGs [@sheilImpactsOpportunitiesOil2009].\nPOME is effluent from the mills and has a high content of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and heavy metals [@hadiyantoPhytoremediationsPalmOil2013]. It also carries large amounts of nutrients such as nitrogen or phosphorus [@jeongPerformanceComparisonMesophilic2014]. Per ton of FFB, 600-700 kg of POME are produced, which are highly toxic to aquatic life forms. Ultimately, this effluent, insufficiently treated in the majority of cases, leads to health risks for the population living along waters with oil palm mills upstream, eventually even affecting crops irrigated with this water.\n\n- noch mehr auf economic growth and rapid development eingehen, oder zu detailliert?\n\nPalm oil has been used mainly in the food (80%) and to a lesser extent in the non-food sector (20%) including biodiesel [@basironOILPALMITS2004]. As interest in renewable fuels increases, demand for palm oil in this sector is rising likewise. 87% of the European Union's (EU) palm oil imports in 2017 were processed into biodiesel [@abdulmajidSustainablePalmOil2021]. This demand is expected to increase even more as the EU has solid legislation around biofuel production [@abdulmajidSustainablePalmOil2021]. But global population growth and the simultaneous increase in demand for vegetable oil will also further increase demand in this area.\n\nThis market, destined to continue growing in the future, urgently requires solutions to reduce its environmental impact. One solution to meet the growing demand for palm oil without expanding cropland is to increase oil extraction rates (OERs). Nevertheless, despite research in this area, the OERs have stagnated at 19-21% over the past 40 years [@changEconomicPerspectiveOil2003; @chewImprovingSustainabilityPalm2021]. Another option to reduce pressure on land conversion is genomic research to improve yields, with various approaches being taken [@murphyOilPalm2020s2021]. A private producer claims that his research has the potential to increase yields by up to 20% [@simedarbyplantationSimeDarbyPlantation2020]. However, after slow yield increases until 2011, it has stagnated thereafter (see @fig-op_yield).\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.ticker as ticker\n# Define the colors\n\ngrey = '#383838'\nred = '#FF0000'\ndark_red = '#8B0000'\n# Load the data from the CSV file\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('../../06_data/vegetation/oil_palm/FAOSTAT_oilpalm.csv')\n# Filter the data for 'Area harvested' and 'Production'\n\ndf_area = df[df['Element'] == 'Area harvested']\ndf_prod = df[df['Element'] == 'Production']\n# Merge the two dataframes on 'Year'\n\ndf_merged = pd.merge(df_area, df_prod, on='Year', suffixes=('_area', '_prod'))\n# Calculate the ratio of 'Production' to 'Area harvested'\n\ndf_merged['Ratio'] = df_merged['Value_prod'] / df_merged['Value_area']\n# Create a figure and axis\n\nfig, ax3 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))  # Adjust the width and height as needed\n# Use seaborn's lineplot function for ratio on the third y-axis\n\n# Use seaborn's lineplot function for ratio on the third y-axis\nsns.lineplot(x='Year', y='Ratio', data=df_merged, ax=ax3, color=grey, label = 'yield / ha', legend = False, linewidth=2.5, marker='o', markersize = 10)\n\n# Create a second y-axis that shares the same x-axis\n\nax2 = ax3.twinx()\n# Use seaborn's lineplot function with the specified colors for the second y-axis\n\nsns.lineplot(x='Year', y='Value_area', data=df_merged, ax=ax2, color=red, label = 'Area harvested', legend = False, linewidth=1 ,marker='o', markersize = 5)\nax2.yaxis.set_major_formatter(ticker.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: '{:,.0f}'.format(x / 1e6)))\n# Create a third subplot for production that shares the same x-axis\n\nax1 = ax3.twinx()\n# Use seaborn's lineplot function with the specified colors for the first y-axis\n\nsns.lineplot(x='Year', y='Value_prod', data=df_merged, ax=ax1, color=dark_red, label = 'Production', legend = False, linewidth=0.5, marker='o', markersize = 5)\nax1.yaxis.set_major_formatter(ticker.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: '{:,.0f}'.format(x / 1e6)))\n# Move the spine of the second axis to the right side of the plot\n\nax2.spines['right'].set_position(('outward', 60))\n# Set title and labels for all y-axes\n\nax3.set_xlabel('Year', labelpad= 10, fontweight = 'bold', fontsize = 12)\nax3.set_ylabel('yield / ha', color=grey, fontweight = 'bold')\nax2.set_ylabel('Area Harvested (Mha)', color=red)\nax1.set_ylabel('Production (Mt)', color=dark_red)\n# Set x-ticks and rotate x-axis labels by 90 degrees\n\nax3.set_xticks(df_merged['Year'])\nax3.set_xticklabels(df_merged['Year'], rotation=90)\n# Set y-axis limits\n\nax3.set_ylim(0, 30)  # Adjust these values as needed for Ratio\nax2.set_ylim(0, 30000000)  # Adjust these values as needed for Area Harvested\nax1.set_ylim(0, 600000000)  # Adjust these values as needed for Production\n# Adjust spines and grid\n\nsns.despine(left=True)\nax3.xaxis.grid(False)\nax3.yaxis.grid(True)\nax2.grid(False)\n# Show the plot\n\nfig.legend(loc=\"upper left\", bbox_to_anchor=(0,1), bbox_transform=ax3.transAxes)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](04_literature_review_files/figure-pdf/cell-2-output-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn summary, oil palm is an essential crop globally, known for its efficiency and high yields in tropical regions. While it has contributed significantly to economic growth, its expansion has come at the cost of deforestation and pollution, posing challenges to biodiversity and ecosystems. Nonetheless, markets will continue to thrive, requiring new solutions to reduce land use change and innovations in processing.\n\n## Sustainable Palm Oil Labels [@abdulmajidSustainablePalmOil2021]\n\nThe Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was established in 2004 with the aim of building a market for certified sustainable palm oil by establishing environmental and social standards for palm oil production. The RSPO is formed by producers, retailers, investors and social and environmental NGOs [@rspoWhoWeAre2023]. RSPO states that compliance with its standards can mitigate the negative impacts of palm oil production on the environment and local communities [-@rspoWhoWeAre2023]. Other labels such as the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) and the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO)\n\n- economic share of the market\n- social advantages/disadvantages\n- environmental improvements\n- criticism\n\n## Other Crops\n\n- evaluating its market share/land use (FAO stats)\n- rubber, pulp wood, rice, coconut, etc.\n\n## Satelite Data\n\nSatellite images have been available for 5 decades. High-resolution data, however, have only become available since this millennium. Since these have now been available for considerable time, temporal changes can also be readily investigated on a small scale. Given the significant contrast between forest areas and anthropogenic surfaces deforestation is well documented .\n\n",
