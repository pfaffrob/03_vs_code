3.2	How much new oil palm occurred on previously deforested areas? (2001 - 2017)

3.3	How much new oil palm plantation area occured yearly on areas previously deforested by forest fires?

3.4	How much new oil palm plantation area occured in protected ares?

3.5	How much new oil palm plantation areo occured on non-forest area? (compared to year 2000 forest cover)

3.6	How much new oil palm plantations occurred yearly on primary forest (2000 - 2017)?

3.7	How much new oil palm plantation area occured on previos cropland (and other way around)?

3.8	How much forest area was ganied on previous oil palm plantation area yearly (2000 - 2012)?

3.9	How much area was used for other crops prior to oil palm plantation, and which?

3.10 How much area was used for oil palm plantation prior to other crops, and which?

**5 Build up areas**
4.1	How Much new build up area was created from 2000 to 2020?

4.2a How much forest loss areas occured on new build up area (yearly)?

4.2b How much primiary forest loss areas occured on new build up area (yearly)?

## \textsc{II} Overlap of 75% closed canopy and primary forest {.unnumbered .unlisted}

\color{white}
[![](../code/results/maps/fcover2000_75_and_primary_forest.png){ width=100% align="center"}]
\normalcolor

Representative map extract showing that >75% closed canopy of 2000 mostly covers the primary forest of 2001.
\newpage

## \textsc{III} Dense vegetation excluding primary forests {.unnumbered .unlisted}

\color{white}
[![](../code/results/maps/vegetation_oil_palm_00_03.png){ width=100% align="center"}]
\normalcolor

In the dense vegetation outside of primary forests, lage areas are occupied by oil palm. Oil palm data is limited to years 2000 - 2003 as growing oil palms could alread have a closed canopy of >75% in the year 2000. 
\newpage

## \textsc{IV} Validation of built up areas in 2000 and deforestation {.unnumbered .unlisted}

\color{white}
[![](../code/results/maps/validation_built_up_deforestation.png){ width=100% align="center"}]
\normalcolor

Example of deforestation on year 2000 built up area, where, logically, no deforestation should be. Here it is visible, that these areas are mainly located at the edge, where maintenance led to the removal of closeby trees, which were thus classifiead as forest loss.
\newpage


## \textsc{V} Secondary Forest and proximity to rivers {.unnumbered .unlisted}

\color{white}
[![](../code/results/maps/reason_secondary_rivers.png){ width=100% align="center"}]
\normalcolor

A repeating pattern, with a lot of secondary forest close to rivers, especially with built-up areas nearby.
\newpage

## \textsc{VI} Logging in PAs {.unnumbered .unlisted}

\color{white}
[![](../code/results/maps/deforestation_protected_areas_other.png){#fig-mappa width="100%"}]
\normalcolor

An exceptional case of a protected PA where much deforestation takes place. A prominent feature is a new road that cuts through the PA.
\newpage

## \textsc{VII} Socondary forest loss in RSPO concessions {.unnumbered .unlisted}


\color{white}

![](../code/results/plots/RSPO_secondary_forest_loss.png){width="65%"}


![](../code/results/plots/RSPO_secondary_forest_loss_uncertified.png){width="65%"}

\normalcolor

Elevated levels of secondary forest loss in RSPO certified concessions and continuous loss in uncertified concessions.

\newpage

## \textsc{VIII} Harvest area SPAM {.unnumbered .unlisted}

\color{white}
![](../code/results/final_plots/SPAM_crops.png)
\normalcolor

These are the harvest areas of shrubby plants given in the crop type datasets, that should be in the same range as the croplands, but they exceed those numbers multiple times indicating their unreliabilty. 

\newpage


## \textsc{IX} Oill palm after forest fies {.unnumbered .unlisted}

\color{white}
![](../code/results/final_plots/new_oil_palm_after_forest_fires.png){#fig-mapdeforestation width="50%"}
\normalcolor

This figure shows, that clearing land for oil palm with fires occurs rarely.
