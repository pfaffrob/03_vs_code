## Data acquisition and selection

Initially, databases such as Web of Knowledge or Google Scholar were searched for GIS and remote sensing studies covering Borneo, Southeast Asia or even a global extent. QGIS (Version 3.30) was used for initial data exploration. This led to the manual selection of data shown in @fig-data_overview for further analysis. Hereafter, the datasets are referred to by the names specified in the Content column. The research area included the landmass of Borneo, explicitly excluding the smaller surrounding islands. This delineation was obtained through the OSMnx python package (), which accesses the Open Street Maps (OSM) database [@boeingOSMnxPythonPackage2017].

## Data preparation

All datasets, which existed in several segments, were merged to cover at least the extent of Borneo.

## Data processing 
For further analysis, a value of >50% tree cover was considered as forest [@hansenHighResolutionGlobalMaps2013].



Aggregated plants and perennial woody plants such as coconut and oil palm were manually removed from subsequent analysis due to the cropland definition in the used dataset [@potapovGlobalMapsCropland2021], as well as crops with a total physical harvest area lower than 10000 ha within the project extent in any of the three datasets.

Please see @fig-data_overview for the table.
