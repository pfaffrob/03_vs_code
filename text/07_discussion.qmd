However, the data showing forest gain in the span of 2001 - 2012 is inaccurate. Analysis showed that 32% of the alleged forest gain represents newly established palm oil plantations. Thus, all new palm oil cultivation areas established between 2001 and 2012 have been removed from the forest gain dataset.

## Data selection 
### Crop harvest area
Existing mapping of cropland all take a similar approach. They disaggregate national and subnational statistics and estimate their allocation to low-resolution grid cells of 5 arcminutes (@wood-sichraSpatialProductionAllocation2016; @youGeneratingPlausibleCrop2009; @yuCultivatedPlanet20102020; @groganGlobalGriddedCrop2022). Among them, the Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM) takes the most factors into account rendering it the most comprehensive data. (@youMappingGlobalCropping2022) Additionally, the dataset family currently contains data for the years 2000, 2005 and 2010, which makes it the most suited choice for the present work (@wood-sichraSpatialProductionAllocation2016; @youGeneratingPlausibleCrop2009; @yuCultivatedPlanet20102020). However, due to improvements in the method of creating the datasets, the more recent ones are a more accurate representation of the physical harvest area and are more finely broken down into distinct crops. (@wood-sichraSpatialProductionAllocation2016; @yuCultivatedPlanet20102020). This is why coconut is missing in the year 2000 even though it was an important crop for both Indonesia and Malaysia at that time (@FAOSTAT).

Although a more recent dataset called Global Agro-ecological Zones (GAEZ v4.0) was available for harvested crops in 2015, no analysis was conducted with it because the data lacked the necessary quality and therefore could not be compared to the SPAM datasets. Just like the SPAM dataset, FAO statistics complemented with national data on FAO gaps, were used to calculate crop yield in a 5 arcminute resolution grid. However, the pixel values in the GAEZ 2015 dataset are based upon the GAEZ 2010 (GAEZ v3.0) dataset, whose download portal does not work anymore (@fao/iiasaGlobalAgroecologicalZones2010). It was calculated by multiplying the year GAEZ 2010 pixel value by the countries' change in the given crop over the last 5 years. As a result, any spatial displacement in the harvest area of a given crop to another region is incorrectly mapped rendering the intended analysis inadequate.

Another available dataset for 2000 was neglected because the SPAM datasets were all created using the same method, which reduces inconsistency when comparing spatiotemporal differences. In addition, only the harvested area was available in the alternative dataset. This means that areas that were harvested several times per year were also counted multiple times, biasing the total physically cultivated area. 

Nevertheless, SPAM data is also subject to non-negligible drawbacks, since ### !!!NOCH ERGÄNZEN!!! ### (@joglekarPixelatingCropProduction2019). 



## Processing
As indicated before, merging data from different sources is challenging. This is especially true for the croplands in higher resolution (~30 m) with the physical harvest area for the individual crops in lower resolution (5 arcminutes). Especially because the two datasets were created with fundamentally different methods. While the dataset of the cultivated areas was created by analysis of satellite data time-series and showing their precise extent (@potapovGlobalMapsCropland2021), the physical harvested area maps of the different crops were compiled by a complex model based on statistics and estimates (@wood-sichraSpatialProductionAllocation2016; @youGeneratingPlausibleCrop2009; @yuCultivatedPlanet20102020). 
Even though a method to aggregate these datasets was developed, the main reason why crops were not further analyzed was that the intersection area of newly detected oil palm plantations was below a total of 80 km² for all of Borneo over the span from 2000 to 2017. Since this represents only such a small fraction of the total cropland (~2000 - ~3500 km²) and 

## Oil Palm

Whilst this thesis allocates ~4 Mha to newly detected oil palm plantations, another paper states a higher number with ~ 5.5 Mha (@gaveauRiseFallForest2019). --> different crs (crs not given), falsely classified to pulp wood as difficult to distinguish.

## Biodiversity

If the deforestation drivers are not addressed, biodiversity will continue to decline, as examined in a case study of the Borneo orangutan (@voigtDeforestationProjectionsImply2022).
