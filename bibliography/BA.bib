  abstract = {Abstract             Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan) sustains \textasciitilde 37 million hectares of native tropical forest. Numerous large-scale infrastructure projects aimed at promoting land-development activities are planned or ongoing in the region. However, little is known of the potential impacts of this new infrastructure on Bornean forests or biodiversity. We found that planned and ongoing road and rail-line developments will have many detrimental ecological impacts, including fragmenting large expanses of intact forest. Assuming conservatively that new road and rail projects will influence only a 1\,km buffer on either side, landscape connectivity across the region will decline sharply (from 89\% to 55\%) if all imminently planned projects proceed. This will have particularly large impacts on wide-ranging, rare species such as rhinoceros, orangutans, and elephants. Planned developments will impact 42 protected areas, undermining Indonesian efforts to achieve key targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity. New infrastructure will accelerate expansion in intact or frontier regions of legal and illegal logging and land colonization as well as illicit mining and wildlife poaching. The net environmental, social, financial, and economic risks of several imminent projects\textemdash such as parallel border roads in West, East, and North Kalimantan, new Trans-Kalimantan road developments in Central Kalimantan and North Kalimantan, and freeways and rail lines in East Kalimantan\textemdash could markedly outstrip their overall benefits. Such projects should be reconsidered in light of rigorous cost-benefit frameworks.},

  abstract = {The globalization of the palm oil trade poses a menace to the ecosystem integrity of Southeast Asia. In this short communication, we briefly discuss why palm oil certifications may have failed as an effective means to halt forest degradation and biodiversity loss. From a comparison of multiple new datasets, we analysed recent tree loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea, and discovered that, from 2001 to 2016, about 40\% of the area located in certified concessions suffered from habitat degradation, deforestation, fires, or other tree damages. Certified concessions have been subject to more tree removals than non-certified ones. We also detect significant tree loss before and after the start of certification schemes. Beyond non-governmental organisations' concern that Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG) certifications allow ongoing clearance of any forest not identified as of high conservation values (HCV) or high carbon stock (HCS), we suggest an alarming and previously overlooked situation, such as that current ``sustainable palm oil'' is often associated with recent habitat degradation and forest loss. In other words, certified palm oil production may not be so sustainable.},

  abstract = {Both deforestation and El Ni\~no events influence Borneo's climate, but their interaction is not well understood. Borneo's native forest cover decreased by 37.1\% between 1980 and 2015 with large areas being replaced by oil palm and a mosaic of plantations and regrowth vegetation. The island is also affected by El Ni\~no events, resulting in severe droughts and fires. Here, we used a high-resolution climate model to simulate and evaluate how deforestation and El Ni\~no episodes interact during the 1980\textendash 2016 period. Simulations revealed that deforestation resulted in a warmer and drier climate with the most pronounced changes in the extensively deforested regions of eastern and southern Borneo. Deforestation-linked impacts were more pronounced under El Ni\~no than neutral (non El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na) conditions. Changes in climate mainly corresponded with areas with the most deforestation. There was a significant increase in the frequency of hotter and drier climatic extremes, with the probability distribution of temperature, humidity and aridity shifting from narrow to a broadening distribution. For example, the frequency of 90th percentile of the hot temperatures (defined as average monthly temperatures {$>$}28.9 {$\smwhtcircle$}C) during the dry season increased from 10\% for neutral conditions for the 1980 forest cover to 22\% for neutral conditions for the 2015 forest cover. For strong El Ni\~no events, the frequency increased from 15.6\% to 32.5\%. Replacement of intact native forest with oil palm resulted in increased frequency of hot temperatures to 49\% for neutral and 74\% for El Ni\~no conditions. Hotter and drier conditions are likely to increase tree mortality and forest flammability (and fire-driven deforestation). The continued reduction and fragmentation of Borneo's forests diminishes the ability to moderate regional climate impacted by larger scale and other regional/local human climate forcings.},

Here we have used a Landsat time series approach to determine the year in which the oil palm plantations are first detected, at which point they are 2 to 3 years of age.

  abstract = {Abstract             Fire in the tropical peatland forests of Borneo is an environmental issue interactioning with climate change and deforestation, and the consequences have local and global implications. While research has shown that fire severity and frequency are expected to increase with climate change, there is conflicting model and observational data as to the effect of deforestation on precipitation, which is a key metric for fire risk. To better understand the changes in fire risk from deforestation and climate change we ran simulations of the climate scenario RCP8.5 with and without total deforestation using regional climate model RegCM4. The output was then used for calculations of the fire weather index. We find that annual temperature change from deforestation at elevations above 500 m is 53\% of the change over the 21st century in RCP8.5. Fire risk is significantly affected by both climate change and deforestation, despite some increases in precipitation from deforestation. While the multi model dry season (June\textendash August) mean increases in fire risk are larger from elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, the increases in maximum fire risk are larger from deforestation. The altitude is a good predictor of fire risk change, with larger increases at more densely populated lower elevations where the peatlands are concentrated and smaller increases at higher elevations. Therefore, while deforestation generally causes a smaller increase in climate-related fire risk than climate change, its local control and heterogeneous effects compared to global carbon emissions makes it critical for climate mitigation policy. These high-resolution simulations provide a guide to the most vulnerable areas of Borneo from climatic increases in fire risk.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Oil seed crops, especially oil palm, are among the most rapidly expanding agricultural land uses, and their expansion is known to cause significant environmental damage. Accordingly, these crops often feature in public and policy debates which are hampered or biased by a lack of accurate information on environmental impacts. In particular, the lack of accurate global crop maps remains a concern. Recent advances in deep-learning and remotely sensed data access make it possible to address this gap. We present a map of closed-canopy oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations by typology (industrial versus smallholder plantations) at the global scale and with unprecedented detail (10\,m resolution) for the year 2019. The DeepLabv3+ model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation, was trained to classify Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images onto an oil palm land cover map. The characteristic backscatter response of closed-canopy oil palm stands in Sentinel-1 and the ability of CNN to learn spatial patterns, such as the harvest road networks, allowed the distinction between industrial and smallholder plantations globally (overall accuracy\,=98.52{$\pm$}0.20\,\%), outperforming the accuracy of existing regional oil palm datasets that used conventional machine-learning algorithms. The user's accuracy, reflecting commission error, in industrial and smallholders was 88.22\,{$\pm$}\,2.73\,\% and 76.56\,{$\pm$}\,4.53\,\%, and the producer's accuracy, reflecting omission error, was 75.78\,{$\pm$}\,3.55\,\% and 86.92\,{$\pm$}\,5.12\,\%, respectively. The global oil palm layer reveals that closed-canopy oil palm plantations are found in 49 countries, covering a mapped area of 19.60\,Mha; the area estimate was 21.00\,{$\pm$}\,0.42\,Mha (72.7\,\% industrial and 27.3\,\% smallholder plantations). Southeast Asia ranks as the main producing region with an oil palm area estimate of 18.69\,{$\pm$}\,0.33\,Mha or 89\,\% of global closed-canopy plantations. Our analysis confirms significant regional variation in the ratio of industrial versus smallholder growers, but it also confirms that, from a typical land development perspective, large areas of legally defined smallholder oil palm resemble industrial-scale plantings. Since our study identified only closed-canopy oil palm stands, our area estimate was lower than the harvested area reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), particularly in West Africa, due to the omission of young and sparse oil palm stands, oil palm in nonhomogeneous settings, and semi-wild oil palm plantations. An accurate global map of planted oil palm can help to shape the ongoing debate about the environmental impacts of oil seed crop expansion, especially if other crops can be mapped to the same level of accuracy. As our model can be regularly rerun as new images become available, it can be used to monitor the expansion of the crop in monocultural settings. The global oil palm layer for the second half of 2019 at a spatial resolution of 10\,m can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4473715 (Descals et al., 2021).},

  abstract = {The rich forests of Indonesian New Guinea are understudied and threatened. We used satellite data to examine annual forest loss, road development and plantation expansion from 2001 to 2019, then developed a model to predict future deforestation. No previous studies have attempted such a detailed assessment of past and future deforestation. In 2019, 34.29 million hectares (Mha), or 83\% of Indonesian New Guinea, supported old-growth forest. Over nineteen years, 2\% (0.75 Mha) were cleared: 45\% (0.34 Mha) converted to industrial plantations, roads, mine tailings, or other uses near cities; 55\% (0.41 Mha) cleared by transient processes including selective natural timber extraction, inland water bodies-related processes, fires, and shifting agriculture. Industrial plantations expanded by 0.23 Mha, with the majority (0.21 Mha; 28\% of forest loss) replacing forests and reaching 0.28 Mha in 2019 (97\% oil palm; 3\% pulpwood). The Trans-Papua Highway, a \textasciitilde 4000 km national investment project, increased by 1554 km. Positive correlations between highway and plantations expansion indicate these are linked processes. Plantations and roads expanded rapidly after 2011, peaked in 2015/16, and declined thereafter. Indonesian government allocated 2.62 Mha of land for the development of industrial plantations (90\% oil palm 10\% pulpwood) of which 74\% (1.95 Mha) remained forest in 2019. A spatial model predicts that an additional 4.5 Mha of forest could be cleared by 2036 if Indonesian New Guinea follows similar relationships to Indonesian Borneo. We highlight the opportunities for policy reform and the importance of working with indigenous communities, local leaders, and provincial government to protect the biological and cultural richness still embodied in this remarkable region.},

  abstract = {The native forests of Borneo have been impacted by selective logging, fire, and conversion to plantations at unprecedented scales since industrial-scale extractive industries began in the early 1970s. There is no island-wide documentation of forest clearance or logging since the 1970s. This creates an information gap for conservation planning, especially with regard to selectively logged forests that maintain high conservation potential. Analysing LANDSAT images, we estimate that 75.7\% (558,060 km2) of Borneo's area (737,188 km2) was forested around 1973. Based upon a forest cover map for 2010 derived using ALOS-PALSAR and visually reviewing LANDSAT images, we estimate that the 1973 forest area had declined by 168,493 km2 (30.2\%) in 2010. The highest losses were recorded in Sabah and Kalimantan with 39.5\% and 30.7\% of their total forest area in 1973 becoming non-forest in 2010, and the lowest in Brunei and Sarawak (8.4\%, and 23.1\%). We estimate that the combined area planted in industrial oil palm and timber plantations in 2010 was 75,480 km2, representing 10\% of Borneo. We mapped 271,819 km of primary logging roads that were created between 1973 and 2010. The greatest density of logging roads was found in Sarawak, at 0.89 km km22, and the lowest density in Brunei, at 0.18 km km22. Analyzing MODIS-based tree cover maps, we estimate that logging operated within 700 m of primary logging roads. Using this distance, we estimate that 266,257 km2 of 1973 forest cover has been logged. With 389,566 km2 (52.8\%) of the island remaining forested, of which 209,649 km2 remains intact. There is still hope for biodiversity conservation in Borneo. Protecting logged forests from fire and conversion to plantations is an urgent priority for reducing rates of deforestation in Borneo.},

Using nation-wide interpretation of satellite imagery, and samplebased error calibration, we estimated the impact of large-scale (industrial) and smallholder oil palm plantations on natural old-growth (``primary'') forests from 2001 to 2019 in Indonesia, the world's largest palm oil producer. Over nineteen years, the area mapped under oil palm doubled, reaching 16.24 Mha in 2019 (64\% industrial; 36\% smallholder), more than the official estimates of 14.72 Mha. The forest area declined by 11\% (9.79 Mha), including 32\% (3.09 Mha) ultimately converted into oil palm, and 29\% (2.85 Mha) cleared and converted in the same year. Industrial plantations replaced more forest than detected smallholder plantings (2.13 Mha vs 0.72 Mha). New plantations peaked in 2009 and 2012 and declined thereafter. Expansion of industrial plantations and forest loss were correlated with palm oil prices. A price decline of 1\% was associated with a 1.08\% decrease in new industrial plantations and with a 0.68\% decrease of forest loss. Deforestation fell below pre-2004 levels in 2017\textendash 2019 providing an opportunity to focus on sustainable management. As the price of palm oil has doubled since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, effective regulation is key to minimising future forest conversion.},

  abstract = {Georeferenced information on road infrastructure is essential for spatial planning, socio-economic assessments and environmental impact analyses. Yet current global road maps are typically outdated or characterized by spatial bias in coverage. In the Global Roads Inventory Project we gathered, harmonized and integrated nearly 60 geospatial datasets on road infrastructure into a global roads dataset. The resulting dataset covers 222 countries and includes over 21 million km of roads, which is two to three times the total length in the currently best available country-based global roads datasets. We then related total road length per country to country area, population density, GDP and OECD membership, resulting in a regression model with adjusted R2 of 0.90, and found that that the highest road densities are associated with densely populated and wealthier countries. Applying our regression model to future population densities and GDP estimates from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios, we obtained a tentative estimate of 3.0\textendash 4.7 million km additional road length for the year 2050. Large increases in road length were projected for developing nations in some of the world's last remaining wilderness areas, such as the Amazon, the Congo basin and New Guinea. This highlights the need for accurate spatial road datasets to underpin strategic spatial planning in order to reduce the impacts of roads in remaining pristine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Accurate mapping of oil palm is important for understanding its past and future impact on the environment. We propose to map and count oil palms by estimating tree densities per pixel for large-scale analysis. This allows for fine-grained analysis, for example regarding different planting patterns. To that end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm density at large scale from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to generate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia. What makes the regression of oil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference data that covers all relevant geographical conditions across a large terri\- tory. Specifically for density estimation, generating reference data involves counting individual trees. To keep the associated labelling effort low we propose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically chooses the most relevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the epistemic model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it possible to retrieve an entire batch of relevant samples in a single iteration. Moreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity and is easily parallelisable to cover large areas. We use our method to compute the first oil palm density map with 10m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD), for all of Indonesia and Malaysia and for two different years, 2017 and 2019. The maps have a mean absolute error of {$\pm$}7.3 trees/ha, estimated from an independent validation set. We also analyse density variations between different states within a country and compare them to official estimates. According to our estimates there are, in total, {$>$}1.2 billion oil palms in Indonesia covering {$>$}15 million ha, and {$>$} 0.5 billion oil palms in Malaysia covering {$>$}6 million ha.},

  abstract = {Deforestation exacerbates climate change through greenhouse gas emissions, but other climatic alterations linked to the local biophysical changes from deforestation remain poorly understood. Here, we assess the impact of tropical deforestation on fire weather risk\textemdash defined as the climate conditions conducive to wildfires\textemdash using high-resolution convection-permitting climate simulations. We consider two land cover scenarios for the island of Borneo: land cover in 1980 (forest scenario) and land cover in 2050 (deforestation scenario) to force a convection-permitting climate model, using boundary conditions from ERA-Interim reanalysis for the 2002\textendash 2016 period. Our findings revealed significant alterations in post-deforestation fire precursors such as increased temperature, wind speed and potential evapotranspiration and decreased humidity, cloud cover and precipitation. As a result, fire weather events that would occur once a year in the forested scenario, are likely to occur four times a year following deforestation. Likewise, for extreme conditions, such as those occurring on longer time-horizons than 20 years, the magnitude of extreme fire weather is likely to double following deforestation. These increases in extreme fire weather conditions demonstrate the key role of tropical forests in regulating regional climate processes, including reduced fire weather risk.},

  abstract = {Palm oil is commonly and increasingly used in many products, despite its association with various problematic ecological, social, and health-related issues. The international Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) label is intended to guide consumers toward more sustainable palm oil product purchases. Unfortunately, it is often the case that consumers profess concern for specific food sustainability issues, yet fail to translate this into sus\- tainable action, for example, by avoiding foods with unsustainable ingredients or by using ecolabels. To investigate the factors associated with this discrepancy in the case of palm oil, the current study explores Swiss consumers' (N = 1076) associations with, perceptions, and awareness of palm oil and the RSPO label through an online survey. Analyses of variance revealed that our participants had mostly negative associations with palm oil, viewed palm oil more negatively than other oils and fats, and lacked acceptance of palm oil in various products; consumers' negative perceptions of palm oil mostly concerned sustainability aspects of the fat. Despite this, only 9 \% of the participants were even aware of the RSPO label. Surprisingly, a regression analysis showed that this discrepancy was also evident among sustainability-concerned consumers. These results indicate that consumers' awareness and knowledge of (unsustainable) ingredients in products and corresponding ecolabels need improvement. To address this, targeted awareness and knowledge-raising interventions and effective marketing could be used. Furthermore, certification organizations should uphold and provide transparency to their sus\- tainability standards.},
