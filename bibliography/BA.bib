  abstract = {Sustainability certification schemes were introduced to the palm oil industry as a response to address the negative environmental and social impacts associated with the development of this industry. The first certification scheme for palm oil, the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), was established in 2004, followed by other non-governmental initiatives to ensure the sustainable production of palm oil. Indonesia and Malaysia, the two largest palm oil producers in the world, established Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) and Malaysia Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) in 2011 and 2015, respectively. This article aims to analyze the existing literature related to studies on the RSPO, MSPO and ISPO on the basis of articles identified from the SCOPUS (scopus.com) and Web of Science (clavirate.com) databases. Results showed that research on the RSPO has been widely conducted compared with that on MSPO and ISPO. Thus, further research on MSPO and ISPO is needed to understand the dynamics of the implementation of sustainability certification. This article also provides an insight on how sustainable certification in the palm oil industry, particularly MSPO, could contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).},

Numerous large-scale infrastructure projects aimed at promoting land-development activities are planned or ongoing in the region. However, little is known of the potential impacts of this new infrastructure on Bornean forests or biodiversity. We found that planned and ongoing road and rail-line developments will have many detrimental ecological impacts, including fragmenting large expanses of intact forest. Assuming conservatively that new road and rail projects will influence only a 1\,km buffer on either side, landscape connectivity across the region will decline sharply (from 89\% to 55\%) if all imminently planned projects proceed. This will have particularly large impacts on wide-ranging, rare species such as rhinoceros, orangutans, and elephants. Planned developments will impact 42 protected areas, undermining Indonesian efforts to achieve key targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity. New infrastructure will accelerate expansion in intact or frontier regions of legal and illegal logging and land colonization as well as illicit mining and wildlife poaching. The net environmental, social, financial, and economic risks of several imminent projects\textemdash such as parallel border roads in West, East, and North Kalimantan, new Trans-Kalimantan road developments in Central Kalimantan and North Kalimantan, and freeways and rail lines in East Kalimantan\textemdash could markedly outstrip their overall benefits. Such projects should be reconsidered in light of rigorous cost-benefit frameworks.},

  abstract = {The globalization of the palm oil trade poses a menace to the ecosystem integrity of Southeast Asia. In this short communication, we briefly discuss why palm oil certifications may have failed as an effective means to halt forest degradation and biodiversity loss. From a comparison of multiple new datasets, we analysed recent tree loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea, and discovered that, from 2001 to 2016, about 40\% of the area located in certified concessions suffered from habitat degradation, deforestation, fires, or other tree damages. Certified concessions have been subject to more tree removals than non-certified ones. We also detect significant tree loss before and after the start of certification schemes. Beyond non-governmental organisations' concern that Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG) certifications allow ongoing clearance of any forest not identified as of high conservation values (HCV) or high carbon stock (HCS), we suggest an alarming and previously overlooked situation, such as that current ``sustainable palm oil'' is often associated with recent habitat degradation and forest loss. In other words, certified palm oil production may not be so sustainable.},

  abstract = {Both deforestation and El Ni\~no events influence Borneo's climate, but their interaction is not well understood. Borneo's native forest cover decreased by 37.1\% between 1980 and 2015 with large areas being replaced by oil palm and a mosaic of plantations and regrowth vegetation. The island is also affected by El Ni\~no events, resulting in severe droughts and fires. Here, we used a high-resolution climate model to simulate and evaluate how deforestation and El Ni\~no episodes interact during the 1980\textendash 2016 period. Simulations revealed that deforestation resulted in a warmer and drier climate with the most pronounced changes in the extensively deforested regions of eastern and southern Borneo. Deforestation-linked impacts were more pronounced under El Ni\~no than neutral (non El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na) conditions. Changes in climate mainly corresponded with areas with the most deforestation. There was a significant increase in the frequency of hotter and drier climatic extremes, with the probability distribution of temperature, humidity and aridity shifting from narrow to a broadening distribution. For example, the frequency of 90th percentile of the hot temperatures (defined as average monthly temperatures {$>$}28.9 {$\smwhtcircle$}C) during the dry season increased from 10\% for neutral conditions for the 1980 forest cover to 22\% for neutral conditions for the 2015 forest cover. For strong El Ni\~no events, the frequency increased from 15.6\% to 32.5\%. Replacement of intact native forest with oil palm resulted in increased frequency of hot temperatures to 49\% for neutral and 74\% for El Ni\~no conditions. Hotter and drier conditions are likely to increase tree mortality and forest flammability (and fire-driven deforestation). The continued reduction and fragmentation of Borneo's forests diminishes the ability to moderate regional climate impacted by larger scale and other regional/local human climate forcings.},

  abstract = {Palm oil is the world's most-produced vegetable oil that is serving as an important source of food and energy for many developing and underdeveloped countries. The global demand for palm oil will continue to rise, owing to the growing population and economy. Presently, tremendous efforts have been devoted to improving the sustainability of palm oil production. One strategy is to improve the oil extraction rate (OER) during the milling process. The average OER in Malaysia has remained stagnant between 19 and 21\% for the past 40 years. Based on the world production of palm oil in 2018, approximately 3 million tonnes of additional palm oil can be produced globally with a 1\% increase in OER. In this paper, the current status of the palm oil milling process and the factors affecting the OER are discussed. Subsequently, the methods to improve the OER are reviewed. Furthermore, the importance of producing good quality oil whilst improving the OER is emphasised. In conclusion, some of the methods reviewed have the potential for industrial application and they warrant further investigation.},

In addition to location, the age of the oil palm plantation is critical for calculating yields. Here we have used a Landsat time series approach to determine the year in which the oil palm plantations are first detected, at which point they are 2 to 3 years of age.

  abstract = {Abstract             Fire in the tropical peatland forests of Borneo is an environmental issue interactioning with climate change and deforestation, and the consequences have local and global implications. While research has shown that fire severity and frequency are expected to increase with climate change, there is conflicting model and observational data as to the effect of deforestation on precipitation, which is a key metric for fire risk. To better understand the changes in fire risk from deforestation and climate change we ran simulations of the climate scenario RCP8.5 with and without total deforestation using regional climate model RegCM4. The output was then used for calculations of the fire weather index. We find that annual temperature change from deforestation at elevations above 500 m is 53\% of the change over the 21st century in RCP8.5. Fire risk is significantly affected by both climate change and deforestation, despite some increases in precipitation from deforestation. While the multi model dry season (June\textendash August) mean increases in fire risk are larger from elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, the increases in maximum fire risk are larger from deforestation. The altitude is a good predictor of fire risk change, with larger increases at more densely populated lower elevations where the peatlands are concentrated and smaller increases at higher elevations. Therefore, while deforestation generally causes a smaller increase in climate-related fire risk than climate change, its local control and heterogeneous effects compared to global carbon emissions makes it critical for climate mitigation policy. These high-resolution simulations provide a guide to the most vulnerable areas of Borneo from climatic increases in fire risk.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Oil seed crops, especially oil palm, are among the most rapidly expanding agricultural land uses, and their expansion is known to cause significant environmental damage. Accordingly, these crops often feature in public and policy debates which are hampered or biased by a lack of accurate information on environmental impacts. In particular, the lack of accurate global crop maps remains a concern. Recent advances in deep-learning and remotely sensed data access make it possible to address this gap. We present a map of closed-canopy oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations by typology (industrial versus smallholder plantations) at the global scale and with unprecedented detail (10\,m resolution) for the year 2019. The DeepLabv3+ model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation, was trained to classify Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images onto an oil palm land cover map. The characteristic backscatter response of closed-canopy oil palm stands in Sentinel-1 and the ability of CNN to learn spatial patterns, such as the harvest road networks, allowed the distinction between industrial and smallholder plantations globally (overall accuracy\,=98.52{$\pm$}0.20\,\%), outperforming the accuracy of existing regional oil palm datasets that used conventional machine-learning algorithms. The user's accuracy, reflecting commission error, in industrial and smallholders was 88.22\,{$\pm$}\,2.73\,\% and 76.56\,{$\pm$}\,4.53\,\%, and the producer's accuracy, reflecting omission error, was 75.78\,{$\pm$}\,3.55\,\% and 86.92\,{$\pm$}\,5.12\,\%, respectively. The global oil palm layer reveals that closed-canopy oil palm plantations are found in 49 countries, covering a mapped area of 19.60\,Mha; the area estimate was 21.00\,{$\pm$}\,0.42\,Mha (72.7\,\% industrial and 27.3\,\% smallholder plantations). Southeast Asia ranks as the main producing region with an oil palm area estimate of 18.69\,{$\pm$}\,0.33\,Mha or 89\,\% of global closed-canopy plantations. Our analysis confirms significant regional variation in the ratio of industrial versus smallholder growers, but it also confirms that, from a typical land development perspective, large areas of legally defined smallholder oil palm resemble industrial-scale plantings. Since our study identified only closed-canopy oil palm stands, our area estimate was lower than the harvested area reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), particularly in West Africa, due to the omission of young and sparse oil palm stands, oil palm in nonhomogeneous settings, and semi-wild oil palm plantations. An accurate global map of planted oil palm can help to shape the ongoing debate about the environmental impacts of oil seed crop expansion, especially if other crops can be mapped to the same level of accuracy. As our model can be regularly rerun as new images become available, it can be used to monitor the expansion of the crop in monocultural settings. The global oil palm layer for the second half of 2019 at a spatial resolution of 10\,m can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4473715 (Descals et al., 2021).},

  abstract = {The rich forests of Indonesian New Guinea are understudied and threatened. We used satellite data to examine annual forest loss, road development and plantation expansion from 2001 to 2019, then developed a model to predict future deforestation. No previous studies have attempted such a detailed assessment of past and future deforestation. In 2019, 34.29 million hectares (Mha), or 83\% of Indonesian New Guinea, supported old-growth forest. Over nineteen years, 2\% (0.75 Mha) were cleared: 45\% (0.34 Mha) converted to industrial plantations, roads, mine tailings, or other uses near cities; 55\% (0.41 Mha) cleared by transient processes including selective natural timber extraction, inland water bodies-related processes, fires, and shifting agriculture. Industrial plantations expanded by 0.23 Mha, with the majority (0.21 Mha; 28\% of forest loss) replacing forests and reaching 0.28 Mha in 2019 (97\% oil palm; 3\% pulpwood). The Trans-Papua Highway, a \textasciitilde 4000 km national investment project, increased by 1554 km. Positive correlations between highway and plantations expansion indicate these are linked processes. Plantations and roads expanded rapidly after 2011, peaked in 2015/16, and declined thereafter. Indonesian government allocated 2.62 Mha of land for the development of industrial plantations (90\% oil palm 10\% pulpwood) of which 74\% (1.95 Mha) remained forest in 2019. A spatial model predicts that an additional 4.5 Mha of forest could be cleared by 2036 if Indonesian New Guinea follows similar relationships to Indonesian Borneo. We highlight the opportunities for policy reform and the importance of working with indigenous communities, local leaders, and provincial government to protect the biological and cultural richness still embodied in this remarkable region.},

  abstract = {The native forests of Borneo have been impacted by selective logging, fire, and conversion to plantations at unprecedented scales since industrial-scale extractive industries began in the early 1970s. There is no island-wide documentation of forest clearance or logging since the 1970s. This creates an information gap for conservation planning, especially with regard to selectively logged forests that maintain high conservation potential. Analysing LANDSAT images, we estimate that 75.7\% (558,060 km2) of Borneo's area (737,188 km2) was forested around 1973. Based upon a forest cover map for 2010 derived using ALOS-PALSAR and visually reviewing LANDSAT images, we estimate that the 1973 forest area had declined by 168,493 km2 (30.2\%) in 2010. The highest losses were recorded in Sabah and Kalimantan with 39.5\% and 30.7\% of their total forest area in 1973 becoming non-forest in 2010, and the lowest in Brunei and Sarawak (8.4\%, and 23.1\%). We estimate that the combined area planted in industrial oil palm and timber plantations in 2010 was 75,480 km2, representing 10\% of Borneo. We mapped 271,819 km of primary logging roads that were created between 1973 and 2010. The greatest density of logging roads was found in Sarawak, at 0.89 km km22, and the lowest density in Brunei, at 0.18 km km22. Analyzing MODIS-based tree cover maps, we estimate that logging operated within 700 m of primary logging roads. Using this distance, we estimate that 266,257 km2 of 1973 forest cover has been logged. With 389,566 km2 (52.8\%) of the island remaining forested, of which 209,649 km2 remains intact. There is still hope for biodiversity conservation in Borneo. Protecting logged forests from fire and conversion to plantations is an urgent priority for reducing rates of deforestation in Borneo.},

  abstract = {The links between plantation expansion and deforestation in Borneo are debated. We used satellite imagery to map annual loss of old-growth forests, expansion of industrial plantations (oil palm and pulpwood), and their overlap in Borneo from 2001 to 2017. In 17 years, forest area declined by 14\% (6.04 Mha), including 3.06 Mha of forest ultimately converted into industrial plantations. Plantations expanded by 170\% (6.20 Mha: 88\% oil palm; 12\% pulpwood). Most forests converted to plantations were cleared and planted in the same year (92\%; 2.83 Mha). Annual forest loss generally increased before peaking in 2016 (0.61 Mha) and declining sharply in 2017 (0.25 Mha). After peaks in 2009 and 2012, plantation expansion and associated forest conversion have been declining in Indonesia and Malaysia. Annual plantation expansion is positively correlated with annual forest loss in both countries. The correlation vanishes when we consider plantation expansion versus forests that are cleared but not converted to plantations. The price of crude palm oil is positively correlated with plantation expansion in the following year in Indonesian (not Malaysian) Borneo. Low palm oil prices, wet conditions, and improved fire prevention all likely contributed to reduced 2017 deforestation. Oversight of company conduct requires transparent concession ownership.},

  abstract = {Much concern about tropical deforestation focuses on oil palm plantations, but their impacts remain poorly quantified. Using nation-wide interpretation of satellite imagery, and samplebased error calibration, we estimated the impact of large-scale (industrial) and smallholder oil palm plantations on natural old-growth (``primary'') forests from 2001 to 2019 in Indonesia, the world's largest palm oil producer. Over nineteen years, the area mapped under oil palm doubled, reaching 16.24 Mha in 2019 (64\% industrial; 36\% smallholder), more than the official estimates of 14.72 Mha. The forest area declined by 11\% (9.79 Mha), including 32\% (3.09 Mha) ultimately converted into oil palm, and 29\% (2.85 Mha) cleared and converted in the same year. Industrial plantations replaced more forest than detected smallholder plantings (2.13 Mha vs 0.72 Mha). New plantations peaked in 2009 and 2012 and declined thereafter. Expansion of industrial plantations and forest loss were correlated with palm oil prices. A price decline of 1\% was associated with a 1.08\% decrease in new industrial plantations and with a 0.68\% decrease of forest loss. Deforestation fell below pre-2004 levels in 2017\textendash 2019 providing an opportunity to focus on sustainable management. As the price of palm oil has doubled since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, effective regulation is key to minimising future forest conversion.},

However, these ecosystems and their associated benefits are threatened by anthropogenic activities, including agricultural conversion, timber harvesting, peatland drainage and associated fire. Here, we identify key challenges, and provide potential solutions and future directions to meet forest and peatland conservation and restoration goals in Indonesia, with a particular focus on Kalimantan.                                                     Through a round-table, dual-language workshop discussion and literature evaluation, we recognized 59 political, economic, legal, social, logistical and research challenges, for which five key underlying factors were identified. These challenges relate to the 3Rs adopted by the Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency (Rewetting, Revegetation and Revitalization), plus a fourth R that we suggest is essential to incorporate into (peatland) conservation planning: Reducing Fires.                                                     Our analysis suggests that (a) all challenges have potential for impact on activities under all 4Rs, and many are inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing, implying that narrowly focused solutions are likely to carry a higher risk of failure; (b) addressing challenges relating to Rewetting and Reducing Fire is critical for achieving goals in all 4Rs, as is considering the local socio-political situation and acquiring local government and community support; and (c) the suite of challenges faced, and thus conservation interventions required to address these, will be unique to each project, depending on its goals and prevailing local environmental, social and political conditions.                                                     With this in mind, we propose an eight-step adaptive management framework, which could support projects in both Indonesia and other tropical areas to identify and overcome their specific conservation and restoration challenges.

Akan tetapi, ekosistem hutan dan lahan gambut beserta manfaatnya terancam oleh tindakan-tindakan antropogenik, diantaranya konversi ke pertanian, pemanenan hutan, drainase gambut dan kebakaran. Disini, kami mengidentifikasi tantangan-tantangan kunci, dan memberikan solusi-solusi potensial serta arahan-arahan di masa depan guna mencapai tujuan-tujuan restorasi dan konservasi gambut di Indonesia dengan fokus khusus di Kalimantan.

Tantangan-tantangan terkait dengan adopsi 3Rs oleh Badan Restorasi Gambut (                     Rewetting, Revegetation                     dan                     Revitalization                     ) dan ditambah R yang ke-empat yang kami sarankan penting untuk dimasukkan ke dalam perencanaan konservasi (gambut): pengurangan kebakaran (                     Reducing Fire                     ).                                                                        Analisis kami menyarankan bahwa (a) seluruh tantangan semuanya memiliki dampak potensial terhadap keseluruhan kegiatan 4Rs, dan kebanyakan saling ketergantungan dan saling memperkuat, yang secara implisit bahwa fokus solusi yang bersifat sempit akan beresiko tinggi mengalami kegagalan; (b) penanganan tantangan terkait pembasahan gambut dan pengurangan kebakaran merupakan hal pokok guna pencapaian tujuan 4Rs secara keseluruhan, dengan mempertimbangkan situasi sosial-politik lokal dan memproleh dukungan pemerintah daerah dan masyarakat setempat; dan (c) dengan kesesuaian dari tantangan-tantangan yang dihadapi sehingga intervensi-intervensi konservasi diperlukan guna mengatasinya sehingga akan menjadi hal yang unik untuk setiap proyek tergantung dengan tujuan dan kondisi-kondisi politik, sosial dan lingkungan yang berlaku.

  abstract = {Worldwide, crop production is intrinsically intertwined with biological, environmental and economic systems, all of which involve complex, inter-related and spatially-sensitive phenomena. Thus knowing the location of agriculture matters much for a host of reasons. There are several widely cited attempts to model the spatial pattern of crop production worldwide, not least by pixilating crop production statistics originally reported on an areal (administrative boundary) basis. However, these modeled measures have had little scrutiny regarding the robustness of their results to alternative data and modeling choices. Our research casts a critical eye over the nature and empirical plausibility of these types of datasets. To do so, we determine the sensitivity of the 2005 variant of the spatial production allocation model data series (SPAM2005) to eight methodological-cum-data choices in nine agriculturally-large and developmentally-variable countries: Brazil, China, Ethiopia, France, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey and the United States. We compare the original published estimates with those obtained from a series of robustness tests using various aggregations of the pixelized spatial production indicators (specifically, commodity-specific harvested area, production quantity and yield). Spatial similarity is empirically assessed using a pixel-level spatial similarity index (SSI). We find that the SPAM2005 estimates are most dependent on the degree of disaggregation of the underlying national and subnational production statistics. The results are also somewhat sensitive to the use of a simple spatial allocation method based solely on cropland proportions versus a cross-entropy allocation method, as well as the set of crops or crop aggregates being modeled, and are least sensitive to the inclusion of crude economic elements. Finally, we assess the spatial concordance between the SPAM2005 estimates of the area harvested of major crops in the United States and pixelated measures derived from remote-sensed data.},

Yet current global road maps are typically outdated or characterized by spatial bias in coverage. In the Global Roads Inventory Project we gathered, harmonized and integrated nearly 60 geospatial datasets on road infrastructure into a global roads dataset. The resulting dataset covers 222 countries and includes over 21 million km of roads, which is two to three times the total length in the currently best available country-based global roads datasets. We then related total road length per country to country area, population density, GDP and OECD membership, resulting in a regression model with adjusted R2 of 0.90, and found that that the highest road densities are associated with densely populated and wealthier countries. Applying our regression model to future population densities and GDP estimates from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios, we obtained a tentative estimate of 3.0\textendash 4.7 million km additional road length for the year 2050. Large increases in road length were projected for developing nations in some of the world's last remaining wilderness areas, such as the Amazon, the Congo basin and New Guinea. This highlights the need for accurate spatial road datasets to underpin strategic spatial planning in order to reduce the impacts of roads in remaining pristine ecosystems.},

In the present study, we present an analysis of global cropland area change for the first two decades of the twenty-first century derived from satellite data time-series. We estimate that, in 2019, the cropland area was 1,244\,Mha with a corresponding total annual net primary production (NPP) of 5.5\,Pg\,C\,year               -1               . From 2003 to 2019, cropland area increased by 9\% and cropland NPP by 25\%, primarily due to agricultural expansion in Africa and South America. Global cropland expansion accelerated over the past two decades, with a near doubling of the annual expansion rate, most notably in Africa. Half of the new cropland area (49\%) replaced natural vegetation and tree cover, indicating a conflict with the sustainability goal of protecting terrestrial ecosystems. From 2003 to 2019, global per-capita cropland area decreased by 10\% due to population growth. However, the per-capita annual cropland NPP increased by 3.5\% as a result of intensified agricultural land use. The presented global, high-resolution, cropland map time-series supports monitoring of natural land appropriation at the local, national and international levels.},

  abstract = {Accurate mapping of oil palm is important for understanding its past and future impact on the environment. We propose to map and count oil palms by estimating tree densities per pixel for large-scale analysis. This allows for fine-grained analysis, for example regarding different planting patterns. To that end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm density at large scale from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to generate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia. What makes the regression of oil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference data that covers all relevant geographical conditions across a large terri\- tory. Specifically for density estimation, generating reference data involves counting individual trees. To keep the associated labelling effort low we propose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically chooses the most relevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the epistemic model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it possible to retrieve an entire batch of relevant samples in a single iteration. Moreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity and is easily parallelisable to cover large areas. We use our method to compute the first oil palm density map with 10m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD), for all of Indonesia and Malaysia and for two different years, 2017 and 2019. The maps have a mean absolute error of {$\pm$}7.3 trees/ha, estimated from an independent validation set. We also analyse density variations between different states within a country and compare them to official estimates. According to our estimates there are, in total, {$>$}1.2 billion oil palms in Indonesia covering {$>$}15 million ha, and {$>$} 0.5 billion oil palms in Malaysia covering {$>$}6 million ha.},

Here, we assess the impact of tropical deforestation on fire weather risk\textemdash defined as the climate conditions conducive to wildfires\textemdash using high-resolution convection-permitting climate simulations. We consider two land cover scenarios for the island of Borneo: land cover in 1980 (forest scenario) and land cover in 2050 (deforestation scenario) to force a convection-permitting climate model, using boundary conditions from ERA-Interim reanalysis for the 2002\textendash 2016 period. Our findings revealed significant alterations in post-deforestation fire precursors such as increased temperature, wind speed and potential evapotranspiration and decreased humidity, cloud cover and precipitation. As a result, fire weather events that would occur once a year in the forested scenario, are likely to occur four times a year following deforestation. Likewise, for extreme conditions, such as those occurring on longer time-horizons than 20 years, the magnitude of extreme fire weather is likely to double following deforestation. These increases in extreme fire weather conditions demonstrate the key role of tropical forests in regulating regional climate processes, including reduced fire weather risk.},

Here, we report primary humid tropical forest extent for the year 2001, and primary forest loss and distance to loss from 2002\textendash 2014 for the largest rainforest countries of Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Indonesia. Brazil's total area of primary forest loss is more than twice that of Indonesia and five times that of DRC. Despite unprecedented success in slowing deforestation along its forest frontier, Brazil's most remote forests are increasingly nearer to loss, as extractive activities such as logging and mining intrude upon previously intact forests. In absolute terms, DRC has the lowest area of primary forest loss; however, its forests are increasingly encroached upon as smallholder agriculturalists move into remaining forests, often to escape conflict and insecurity. The decrease in DRC forests' distance to loss as a function of area of forest loss was five times that of Brazil or Indonesia. In 2014, Indonesia had the least area of remaining primary forest. Despite an announced moratorium on concession licenses in 2011, Indonesia exhibited a rate of primary forest loss twice that of DRC and triple that of Brazil by the end of the study period. Forest loss dynamics in Indonesia range from industrial-scale clearing of coastal peatlands to logging of interior montane rainforests. While results illustrate considerable variation in forest loss dynamics between the three countries, the dominant narrative is of ongoing exploitation of primary humid tropical forests.},

  abstract = {Forest fires contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions and can negatively affect public health, economic activity, and provision of ecosystem services. In boreal forests, fires are a part of the ecosystem dynamics, while in the humid tropics, fires are largely humaninduced and lead to forest degradation. Studies have shown changing fire dynamics across the globe due to both climate and land use change. However, global trends in firerelated forest loss remain uncertain due to the lack of a globally consistent methodology applied to high spatial resolution data. Here, we create the first global 30-m resolution satellite-based map of annual forest loss due to fire. When producing this map, we match the mapped area of forest loss due to fire to the reference area obtained using a samplebased unbiased estimator, thus enabling map-based area reporting and trend analysis. We find an increasing global trend in forest loss due to fire from 2001 to 2019, driven by near-uniform increases across the tropics, subtropical, and temperate Australia, and boreal Eurasia. The results quantify the increasing threat of fires to remaining forests globally and may improve modeling of future forest fire loss rates under various climate change and development scenarios.},

  abstract = {Palm oil is commonly and increasingly used in many products, despite its association with various problematic ecological, social, and health-related issues. The international Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) label is intended to guide consumers toward more sustainable palm oil product purchases. Unfortunately, it is often the case that consumers profess concern for specific food sustainability issues, yet fail to translate this into sus\- tainable action, for example, by avoiding foods with unsustainable ingredients or by using ecolabels. To investigate the factors associated with this discrepancy in the case of palm oil, the current study explores Swiss consumers' (N = 1076) associations with, perceptions, and awareness of palm oil and the RSPO label through an online survey. Analyses of variance revealed that our participants had mostly negative associations with palm oil, viewed palm oil more negatively than other oils and fats, and lacked acceptance of palm oil in various products; consumers' negative perceptions of palm oil mostly concerned sustainability aspects of the fat. Despite this, only 9 \% of the participants were even aware of the RSPO label. Surprisingly, a regression analysis showed that this discrepancy was also evident among sustainability-concerned consumers. These results indicate that consumers' awareness and knowledge of (unsustainable) ingredients in products and corresponding ecolabels need improvement. To address this, targeted awareness and knowledge-raising interventions and effective marketing could be used. Furthermore, certification organizations should uphold and provide transparency to their sus\- tainability standards.},

The increased food, fiber and fuel demand from this population will significantly affect land and resource use, climate change, the nature and prevalence of poverty, political agendas and technological development. Preemptively addressing the effects of this increased demand is aided by a clear and reliable understanding of the current spatial distribution of cropping systems in the world. The Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM) 2005 endeavors to disaggregate crop statistics identified at national and sub-national units for the year 2005 to 5 arc-minute grid cells while taking account of different farming practices. SPAM generates four major output variables: physical area, harvested area, production quantity and yield for each of 42 crops distinguished by four production systems (i.e., irrigated \textendash{} high input, rainfed \textendash{} high input, rainfed \textendash{} low-input and rainfed \textendash{} subsistence production). The allocation model uses a cross-entropy optimization approach informed by major inputs such as cropland surface, location of irrigated areas, crop suitability and potential yields, rural population densities, production systems characteristics and crop prices to disaggregate crop statistics. Our primary intent is to document the data sources used to compile the SPAM2005 estimates, to outline the major features of the model itself, as well as the adjustments and modifications undertaken to generate these plausible spatial estimates of crop area, production and yield.},

  abstract = {Large gaps exist in our knowledge of the current geographic distribution and spatial patterns of performance of crops, and these gaps are unlikely to be filled. In addition, even the spatial scale of many subnational statistical reporting units remains too coarse to capture patterns of spatial heterogeneity in crop production and performance that are likely important from a policy and investment planning perspective. To fill these spatial data gaps we have developed and applied a meso-scale model for the spatial disaggregation of crop production. Using a cross-entropy approach, our model makes plausible pixel-scale assessments of the spatial distribution of crop production within geopolitical units (e.g. countries or sub-national provinces and districts). The pixel-scale allocations are performed through the compilation and judicious fusion of relevant spatially-explicit data, including: production statistics, land use data, satellite imagery, biophysical crop ``suitability'' assessments, population density, and distance to urban centers, as wells as any prior knowledge about the spatial distribution of individual crops. The development, application and validation of a prior version of the model in Brazil strongly suggested that our spatial allocation approach shows considerable promise. This paper describes efforts to generate crop distribution maps for Sub-Saharan Africa for the year 2000 using this approach. Apart from the empirical challenge of applying the approach across many countries, the application includes three significant model improvements: (1) the ability to cope with production data sources that provided different degrees of spatial disaggregation for different crops within a single country; (2) the inclusion of a digital map of irrigation intensity as a new input layer; and (3) increased disaggregation of rainfed production systems. Applying the modified spatial allocation model we generated 5 min (approximately 10 km) resolution grid maps for the following 20 major crops across Sub-Saharan Africa: barley, dry beans, cassava, cocoa, coffee, cotton, cow peas, groundnuts, maize, millet, oil palm, plantain, potato, rice, sorghum, soybeans, sugar cane, sweet potato, wheat, and yam. The approach provides plausible results but also highlights the need for much more reliable input data for the region, especially with regard to sub-national production statistics and satellite-based estimates of cropland extent and intensity.},

We then pointed out the future perspectives and directions in further improving the global cropping data products. Collective mechanisms and efforts with the support of open-access data hosting platforms, standard protocols, and consistent financial support are necessary to produce high-quality datasets for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

SPAM2010 adds further methodological and data enhancements to the available crop downscaling modeling, which mainly include the update of base year, the extension of crop list, and the expansion of subnational administrative-unit coverage. Specifically, it not only applies the latest global synergy cropland layer (see Lu et al., submitted to the current journal) and other relevant data but also expands the estimates of crop area, yield, and production from 20 to 42 major crops under four farming systems across a global 5 arcmin grid. All the SPAM maps are freely available at the MapSPAM website (http://mapspam.info/, last access: 11 December 2020), which not only acts as a tool for validating and improving the performance of the SPAM maps by collecting feedback from users but is also a platform providing archived global agricultural-production maps for better targeting the Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, SPAM2010 can be downloaded via an open-data repository (DOI: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PRFF8V; IFPRI, 2019).},
